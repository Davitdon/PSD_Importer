Dragging and dropping psds from file system doesn't work.
I was too lazy to find out the solution

So I made a PSD Importer Dock,

Drag and Drop a .psd file into the PSD_Importer Dock (From External external file system)
or
Press the CheckFileSystem, Find your PSD file

Choose Import Type

Frame and Item works
Frame, is default psd layout (doesn't work correctly)
Item, is AnimatedSprite2D, with an animation called direction (Good if you have multiple directions of the same item)
